symmetric-polynomials Haskell library
=====================================

This is a (work-in-progress) Haskell library to compute in the ring of symmetric functions.

It supports the standard bases:

* elementary symmetric polynomials
* complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials
* monomial symmetric polynomials
* power symmetric polynomials
* Schur polynomials

and conversions between these.
